# Algorithms
These contain solutions to the [Algorithm class](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/algorithms) by Tim Roughgarden on Coursera. Complete solutions to Part-1 of the course have been provided, however Part-2 is a WIP and will be completed shortly.

## Features
* Precompiled executables of the C/C++ codes in <b>a.out</b> format are already present alongside the codes in the respecive directories.
* Both the input and the output are provided alongside the code in <b>.txt</b> format. The input.txt (test-case from the question) is fed to the code which processes and stores the result in output.txt .
* In some exercises a shell script is also provided to facilate statistical measurement of the output as required by certain questions in the course assingments.

## How to use them ?
Users should set-up an environment which supports C/C++ like GNU or IDEs which support C/C++. You can simply compile them and run the executable.

An example is given below for linux environment, open a terminal in the directory in which the code is present and execute the following commands:
```
// For C codes:
gcc <name of file>
./a.out

// For C++ codes:
g++ <name of file>
./a.out
```
